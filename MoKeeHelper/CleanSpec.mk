# If you don't need to do a full clean build but would like to touch
# a file or delete some intermediate files, add a clean step to the end
# of the list.  These steps will only be run once, if they haven't been
# run before.
#
# E.g.:
#     $(call add-clean-step, touch -c external/sqlite/sqlite3.h)
#     $(call add-clean-step, rm -rf $(PRODUCT_OUT)/obj/STATIC_LIBRARIES/libz_intermediates)
#
# Always use "touch -c" and "rm -f" or "rm -rf" to gracefully deal with
# files that are missing or have been moved.
#
# Use $(PRODUCT_OUT) to get to the "out/target/product/blah/" directory.
# Use $(OUT_DIR) to refer to the "out" directory.
#
# If you need to re-do something that's already mentioned, just copy
# the command and add it to the bottom of the list.  E.g., if a change
# that you made last week required touching a file and a change you
# made today requires touching the same file, just copy the old
# touch step and add it to the end of the list.
#
# ************************************************
# NEWER CLEAN STEPS MUST BE AT THE END OF THE LIST
# ************************************************

# For example:
#$(call add-clean-step, rm -rf $(OUT_DIR)/target/common/obj/APPS/AndroidTests_intermediates)
#$(call add-clean-step, rm -rf $(OUT_DIR)/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/core_intermediates)
#$(call add-clean-step, find $(OUT_DIR) -type f -name "IGTalkSession*" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f)
#$(call add-clean-step, rm -rf $(PRODUCT_OUT)/data/*)
